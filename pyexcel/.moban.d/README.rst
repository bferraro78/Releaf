Usage
===============

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import pyexcel
    >>> content = "1,2,3\n3,4,5"
    >>> sheet = pyexcel.Sheet()
    >>> sheet.csv = content
    >>> sheet.array
    [[1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5]]
    >>> with open("myfile.xlsx", "wb") as output:
    ...     write_count_not_used = output.write(sheet.xlsx)



Suppose you have the following data in a dictionary:

========= ====
Name      Age
========= ====
Adam      28
Beatrice  29
Ceri      30
Dean      26
========= ====

you can easily save it into an excel file, using the following code.

.. code-block:: python

   >>> import pyexcel
   >>> # make sure you had pyexcel-xls installed
   >>> a_list_of_dictionaries = [
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Adam',
   ...         "Age": 28
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Beatrice',
   ...         "Age": 29
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Ceri',
   ...         "Age": 30
   ...     },
   ...     {
   ...         "Name": 'Dean',
   ...         "Age": 26
   ...     }
   ... ]
   >>> pyexcel.save_as(records=a_list_of_dictionaries, dest_file_name="your_file.xls")


Here are the method to obtain the records:

.. code-block:: python
   
   >>> import pyexcel as pe
   >>> records = pe.iget_records(file_name="your_file.xls")
   >>> for record in records:
   ...     print("%s is aged at %d" % (record['Name'], record['Age']))
   Adam is aged at 28
   Beatrice is aged at 29
   Ceri is aged at 30
   Dean is aged at 26
   >>> pe.free_resources()


Acknowledgement
===============

All great work have been done by odf, ezodf, xlrd, xlwt, tabulate and other
individual developers. This library unites only the data access code.


.. testcode::
   :hide:
   
   >>> import os
   >>> os.unlink("your_file.xls")
   >>> os.unlink("myfile.xlsx")
